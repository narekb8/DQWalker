# Slimewalker

A small, Arduino based project to create a Pokewalker-inspired device based on the Slime from Dragon Quest and its variants from Dragon Warrior Monsters II.

This was originally made as a birthday gift to my girlfriend which quickly spiraled out of control in its scope, and now the code is (almost) complete. PCB and 3D case designs are currently WIP, as I've never done designs before. I hope to eventually port this over to the base SAMD21 SDK, but Arduino was used for the convenience of the available libraries (even if some of them don't work).
